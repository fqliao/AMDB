In order to overcome the limitations of local storage in version 1.0,we add support for distributed storage system in version 2.0,which is called AMDB.
AMDB has following advantages:
- It supports multiple storage engines and chooses highly available distributed storage system which can support data expansion easily and quickly.
- It separates computation from data, thus node failure will not lead to data anomalies.
- Data is stored remotely and can be stored in a safer isolation area, which is very significant in many scenarios.
- Distributed storage not only supports the form of Key-Value, but also supports the way of SQL, which makes business development easier.
- The storage of world state is also changed from MPT to distributed storage,which  avoids the problem of performance degradation caused by rapid expansion of world state.
- It optimizes the structure of data storage,saves storage space and has higher access efficiency.
